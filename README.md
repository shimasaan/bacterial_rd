## Includings
### ./Experimental_Data/Reductive_division
Data for the cell size distributions etc..
### ./Experimental_Data/Rhodamine_experiment
Data for the performance evaluation using rhodamine.
### ./Experimental_Data/Velocity_analyses
Data for the performance evaluation measuring velocity fields.
### ./Simulations_Codes/Model(based_on_Ho_and_Amir)
Source codes for the simulation based on the model by Ho and Amir.
Phase_transition: source codes for the analyses of the violation of the scale invariance.
### ./Simulations_Codes/Model(based_on_Witz_etal)
Source codes for the simulation based on the model by Witz et al.
Phase_transition: source codes for the analyses of the violation of the scale invariance.
#### For simulation codes
The calculation results are not included because the data size is very large (~200MB for each calculation).
